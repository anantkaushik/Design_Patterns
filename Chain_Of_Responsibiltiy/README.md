# Chain of Responsibility
> Chain of Responsibility is a behavioral design pattern that lets you pass requests along a chain of handlers. 
> Upon receiving a request, each handler decides either to process the request or to pass it to the next handler 
> in the chain.


### Applicability:
- Use the Chain of Responsibility pattern when your program is expected to process different kinds of requests in 
  various ways, but the exact types of requests and their sequences are unknown beforehand.
- Use the pattern when itâ€™s essential to execute several handlers in a particular order.
