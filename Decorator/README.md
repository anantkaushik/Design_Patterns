# Decorator Pattern
> Decorator is a structural design pattern that lets you attach new behaviors to objects by placing these objects 
> inside special wrapper objects that contain the behaviors.

## Applicability
- Use the Decorator pattern when you need to be able to assign extra behaviors to objects at runtime without breaking 
  the code that uses these objects.
- Use the pattern when it’s awkward or not possible to extend an object’s behavior using inheritance.
