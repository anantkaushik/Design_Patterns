# Visitor
> Visitor is a behavioral design pattern that lets you separate algorithms from the objects on which they operate. 
> The Visitor pattern suggests that you place the new behavior into a separate class called visitor, instead of 
> trying to integrate it into existing classes. The original object that had to perform the behavior is now passed to 
> one of the visitorâ€™s methods as an argument, providing the method access to all necessary data contained within 
> the object.

### Applicability:
- Use the Visitor when you need to perform an operation on all elements of a complex object structure (for example, 
  an object tree).
- Use the Visitor to clean up the business logic of auxiliary behaviors.
- Use the pattern when a behavior makes sense only in some classes of a class hierarchy, but not in others.
