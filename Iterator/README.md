# Iterator
> Iterator is a behavioral design pattern that lets you traverse elements of a collection without exposing its 
> underlying representation (list, stack, tree, etc.).

### Applicability:
- Use the Iterator pattern when your collection has a complex data structure under the hood, but you want to hide its 
  complexity from clients (either for convenience or security reasons).
- Use the pattern to reduce duplication of the traversal code across your app.
- Use the Iterator when you want your code to be able to traverse different data structures or when types of these 
  structures are unknown beforehand.
