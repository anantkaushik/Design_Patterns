# Single Responsibility Principle [SRP]

The single responsibility principle (SRP) states that every class or module in a program should have responsibility for just a single piece of that program’s functionality. Further, the elements of that responsibility should be encapsulated by the responsible class rather than spread out in unrelated classes. The developer and chief evangelist of the SRP, Robert C. Martin, describes a responsibility as a “reason to change.” So, another way of putting the SRP is to say, as Martin does, that “a class should have only one reason to change.”

In simple words we can say one class should have only one responsibility.

## What is Responsibility
Responsibility is the work or action that each part of your system, the methods, the classes, the packages, the modules are assigned to do.
> Too much responsibility leads to coupling.
