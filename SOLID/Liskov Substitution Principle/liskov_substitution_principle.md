# Liskov Substitution Principle

Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes.

> Child class objects should be able to replace parent class objects without breaking the integrity of the application.

>The Liskov substitution principle helps by limiting your use of inheritance. While it is easy to come up with low-level, concrete implementation classes (hey, they do what you want them to do), it is better to step back and think of a high-level abstraction.
