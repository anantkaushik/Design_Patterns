# State

> A pattern in which the object's behaviour is determined by its state. An object transitions from one state to another 
> (something needs to trigger a transition). A formalised construct which manages state and transitions is called a 
> state machine.


### Applicability:
- Use the State pattern when you have an object that behaves differently depending on its current state, the number of 
  states is enormous, and the state-specific code changes frequently.
- Use the pattern when you have a class polluted with massive conditionals that alter how the class behaves according 
  to the current values of the classâ€™s fields.
- Use State when you have a lot of duplicate code across similar states and transitions of a condition-based state 
  machine.
