# Observer
> Observer is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify multiple objects 
> about any events that happen to the object theyâ€™re observing.

### Applicability:
- Use the Observer pattern when changes to the state of one object may require changing other objects, and the actual 
  set of objects is unknown beforehand or changes dynamically.
- Use the pattern when some objects in your app must observe others, but only for a limited time or in specific cases.
