# Mediator
> Mediator is a behavioral design pattern that lets you reduce chaotic dependencies between objects. 
> The pattern restricts direct communications between the objects and forces them to collaborate only via a 
> mediator object.

> A component that facilitates communication between other components without them necessarily being aware of each other 
> or having direct (reference) access to each other.
