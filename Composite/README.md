# Composite Pattern

> A mechanism for treating individual (scalar) objects and compositions of objects in a uniform manner.
> Composite is a structural design pattern that lets you compose objects into tree structures and then work with these 
> structures as if they were individual objects.

### Applicability:
- Use the Composite pattern when you have to implement a tree-like object structure.
- Use the pattern when you want the client code to treat both simple and complex elements uniformly.
