# Abstract Factory
> Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern that lets you produce families of related objects without specifying 
> their concrete classes.

> Use the Abstract Factory when your code needs to work with various families of related products, 
> but you don’t want it to depend on the concrete classes of those products—they might be unknown beforehand or 
> you simply want to allow for future extensibility.
