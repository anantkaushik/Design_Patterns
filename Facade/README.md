> Facade is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework, or any other 
> complex set of classes.

### Applicability:
- Use the Facade pattern when you need to have a limited but straightforward interface to a complex subsystem.
- Use the Facade when you want to structure a subsystem into layers.
